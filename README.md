# Belly Button (Biodiversity) Challenge

Welcome to the **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard**! Dive into the fascinating world of microbes living on us (yes, even in belly buttons) and explore the unique biodiversity data collected from different individuals. It's data visualization, but make it *weirdly cool*! ðŸŽ‰

## Whatâ€™s This All About?

Scientists studied microbes that live in human navels (yes, *navels*). They discovered that while a small group of microbes dominate, the rest are a rare, diverse mix. This project visualizes that data in an interactive dashboard.

Whatâ€™s in it for you? You get to:
- Learn which microbes are the *VIPs* of belly button biodiversity.
- Explore the microbial profiles of individuals.
- Interact with beautifully rendered charts to satisfy your curiosity.

## Features 

- **Dynamic Dropdown Menu**: Select any test subject to see their microbial data. Curious? Go ahead and explore!
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 most prominent bacterial species for each individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: A fun, interactive way to visualize bacteria across different individuals.
- **Demographic Info Panel**: Get to know each test subject (anonymously, of course!)â€”age, location, and more.

## Files Youâ€™ll Find Here 

- `index.html`: The main file to load the dashboard in your browser.
- `static/js/app.js`: All the JavaScript magic happens hereâ€”data fetching, chart building, and interactivity.
- `samples.json`: The data source containing all the fascinating information on microbes and demographics.

## How It Works 

1. **Data Fetching**: The project uses **D3.js** to fetch and process the dataset.
2. **Dynamic Charts**: Charts are built using **Plotly.js** for maximum interactivity and aesthetics.
3. **Responsive Updates**: Select a test subject, and watch the dashboard update with their data.

## Why This Matters 

Microbes are everywhereâ€”and theyâ€™re essential! They affect our health, environment, and more. This dashboard is a small peek into that invisible world, bringing the data to life for anyone curious about the biodiversity we carry with us.
